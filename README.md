# [Welcome to Yeetball VR!](https://medium.com/@maxwell_lovell/devlog-0-welcome-to-yeetball-vr-b48156424c23)

Our team is creating a fast-paced multiplayer VR game, where two small teams are pitted together against each other. The goal? Gain the most points by collecting and defending objective objects at your base, all the while acquiring upgrades for both your abilities and upgrading structures around your base. Make quick decisions between defending, upgrading, and attacking your opponents to win the game! Think of it somewhere between a game of capture the flag, dodge ball, and a MOBA. We felt like creating a unique experience that combines some of our favorite things in virtual reality, interacting with others, and feeling awesome. There’s nothing quite like flying through the air to make an awesome play, eliminating an opponent.

## Meet The Team:

### Matthew Feliciano, VR Unity Engineer: Gameplay Programmer & Engineer
“Hi, I’m Matt! Designing and developing applications is one of my passions. Learning is another. Both came together great for this project, I’m excited to see how this game is received!” https://github.com/Mfeliciano778

### Erickson Paschke, VR Unity Engineer: Gameplay and Graphics Designer
“Hello, I’m Erickson, and I like to program and create 3D graphics. Game Feel is very important to me and I want to make sure the experience is intuitive and enjoyable” https://github.com/epaschke22

### Maxwell Lovell, VR Unity Engineer: Gameplay System and Networking Engineer
“Hey, I’m Max, also the one writing the article! I love creating coding the logic behind things in-game, and ensuring it’s modular and scalable for my future works. I am excited to work on this project.” https://github.com/maxlov

The current gameplay flow looks like this:

- Players join a lobby, select teams, and start the game.
- In the game, both teams gain points by capturing score orbs or getting a large chunk of 3 objective pieces back to the ‘nest’. Players are able to spend their team points to give themselves buffs, such as jump height, speed, and later on health and damage.
- At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins!

We plan on adding ways for players to defend their base, so they can maximize the objective pieces captured. Players will be able to spend their team’s score to purchase traps, projectiles, and more to be able slow down their opponents.
